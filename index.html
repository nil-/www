It's like competitive video gaming... but socially accepted! To be honest I
actually prefer Go due to <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_complexity#Complexities_of_some_well-known_games">higher
game complexity</a>, but no one plays it so now I rarely do either. I've grown
to love chess though, particularly because of the larger amount of theory
developed in the metagame.

Zero sum games with incomplete information are just so so fun, especially if
there's RNG involved. It's an added layer of complexity in trying to reach the
highest expected value, and not simply the highest deterministic score.
<br><br>
My playing style tends to vary depending on the table. I usually play
fundamental poker (and thus tight aggressive) against fish, and I become more
and more loose as the players are more skillful and thus willing to give up
pots.

I was 12-tabling at 5/10 NL and making quite a bit of money during senior year
of high school and early freshman year in college. Now if only online gambling
wasn't still illegal..

I love the following in no particular order: Vim, Colemak, GNU/Linux tiling
managers, Vim-keybinded applications, and ultra-lightweight software.
<br><br>
It's so rewarding to create personal programs to accomodate your needs, for
example, an automated script to save you time from having to do a menial task on
a regular basis. Simple and modular is my philosophy. There's also the aesthetic
appeal that I admire about ultra-customizability in Unix.
<br><br>
Unlike most neckbeards, however, I really am not so concerned about the Free
Software Movement, user privacy, and elitist programming-to-newbie attitudes,
e.g., RTFMP. Not using proprietary software ironically restricts one's freedom;
Google is doing more good than evil; closeted societies are worse than Hitler.

I enjoy all mediums, although I'm currently most fond of lit and films. I
usually abide by western convention—solid character development, presentation,
plot progression, and overall message. I do however have a preference for
atmosphere more than most, and am also not one to fault, say, eastern works from
a western penchant.
<br><br>
I would say my attitude in general leans toward art house works, in visuals, in
prose, or in whatever lends the most strength and is most niche to the medium. I
find they really challenge the meaning of art and the expression within it.
<br><br>
Looking at my lists, I also seem to enjoy bildungsroman a lot, and am partial to
a tinge of cheesiness in my stories (I blame my upbringing for the latter).

Writing happens to be one of my favorite activities because it requires
expression from deep-seated feeling. I also find it to be the most valuable time
sink: it's a personal accomplishment that you'll always look back and feel proud
of. It's your own unique creation. With a scientific discovery, another person
in the future could have (and will) find it eventually, but within the
humanities you can be proud to say that your own work is precisely that. Too bad
I'm not good at it.

One of the many interests I wish I had more time to practice. In another life
without monetary needs, I would've pursued my dream of playing professionally in
an orchestra. Math and logic describe the universe but music describes the soul;
give me a few more years and I'll finally afford those cello lessons!

Typical poor college student—I play the piano and guitar, and for a year as a
freshman, the ukelele too because it was a surefire way to pick up girls. I also
played the flute since middle school band, of which I had a lot of potential in
high school regionals before I dropped out altogether. Public school was killing
my love for music.

I'm partial to minimalist clothing, detail, and silhouettes. Not so big on colors or
loud pieces, as I usually prefer a monochrome colorscheme: blacks, greys,
whites, the occasional dark navy and brown leather. I'm inspired by avant
garde fashion and Japanese streetwear; Yohji Yamamoto, Julius, and Raf Simons
are my favorite designers.

It's really satisfying to have that cool draft of wind hug you as I sail down a
road. More scenery is always cool too. I personally enjoy it most as an urban
activity, since the roads are less grainy, the ambience more noisy, and the
world more alive.

          <h3>Other Activities: Weightlifting</h3>
          <p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 50px; padding-right: 50px; padding-bottom: 30px;">
I love/hate weightlifting, because it's the most efficient way to build muscles
but it's also extremely boring. I quickly lose motivation to do weightlifting
instead of cardio because workout routines just feel so robotic. "Lift that X
reps, squat X lbs, repeat." Then again, 5 hours of weightlifting a week is
pretty much all that's needed to grant optimal fitness. 5!

Studying language structures is a pleasant exercise in logic, so I tend to look
at linguistics as a whole on a more scientific basis than those based in the
humanities. Examining history and influences on past civilizations, and all that
mumbo jumbo, is certainly fun too. (Although, I find <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing">NLP</a>
applications infinitely more interesting.)
<br><br>
As one of the consequences, I do tend to get a kick out of acquiring languages
as well. I currently <s>can bullshit</s> know the following: French (basic),
Latin (basic), Vietnamese (advanced), Japanese (basic), Spanish (advanced).
